The Code and exp

This test will verify the frequency setting of the timer driver.
The module under test is responsible for timing all of the other modules in the system.
Connect an oscilloscope probe to the pin listed in timerDriver_Int.h
You should measure a square wave with a frequency of TIMER_FREQ / 2
