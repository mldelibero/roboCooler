3.3 Specifying the Load Capacitance
The purpose here is to find the capacitance values for the two external capacitors connected to the crystal.

3.4 Oscillator Transconductance
We need to make sure that there is enough gain in the circuit to start up the oscillation.

gain_margin = g_m / g_mcrit
g_mcrit = 4 * ESR * (2*pi*f)^2 * 
This needs to be > 5. It is pretty close.


3.5.1 Drive Level
I am going to skip this b/c I don't have the instrumentation to measure it.
Max Drive Level = 100uW (10uW typical)


3.5.3
R_EXT has the purpose of limiting the drive level of the crystal and filtering out overtones of the fundamental frequency.

R_EXT = 1 / (2*pi*f*C_L2) = 904Ohms

Recalculate the gain margin:
g_mcrit = 4 * (ESR+R_EXT) * (2*pi*f)^2 * (C_0+C_L)^2


--- I can't find a crystal that allows for enough gain at the end. The problem is a low g_m and adding any extern (R_EXT) resistance kills the oscillation.

3.2.3 Drive Level
DL = ESR * (pi*f*(C_L + C_M)*Vpp)^2
Vpp is the peak to peak voltage across the crystal (Can we assume 1.2V)
C_M is the motional capacitance. Part of the xtl model. This parameter is is typically not given in the datasheet.
